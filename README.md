# Hi, I’m Frank L 👋

I focus on how cybersecurity decisions are made under real-world constraints, not just on the tools involved.

## What I Do
- Cybersecurity governance & risk analysis
- Risk-based monitoring and detection strategy
- Incident response decision-making and escalation
- Third-party risk management (TPRM)
- IT & OT / ICS security considerations

## How I Think About Security
My work emphasizes:
- **Why** something should be monitored, not just how
- Explicit documentation of coverage gaps and accepted risk
- Clear ownership, escalation paths, and accountability
- Security decisions that leadership and auditors can defend

> These projects represent how I think about cybersecurity problems and decisions, not systems I personally operated in production.
